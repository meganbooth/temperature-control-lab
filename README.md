# Temperature Control Lab

This project models heat transfer using the [TCLab](https://apmonitor.com/pdc/index.php/Main/TemperatureControl) to determine the thermal conductivity of three materials: metal, plastic, and cardboard. The setup includes two temperature sensors with each material placed in between to simulate real-world insulation scenarios, such as thermal management between a smartphone battery and processor.

## Objective

- Collect and analyze real sensor data from the TCLab
- Estimate thermal conductivity for each material
- Build a basic digital twin to simulate heat transfer dynamics

## Real-World Context

To simulate a practical challenge, this lab replicates the thermal interaction between components in a next-generation cell phone. Materials are evaluated based on their ability to prevent heat transfer between the processor and battery, with the goal of avoiding overheating.

## Tools & Methods

- Hardware: TCLab temperature sensors + microcontroller
- Software: Python (data collection, plotting, and modeling)
- Methods: Experimental data collection, curve fitting, thermal analysis

## Results
